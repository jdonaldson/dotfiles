- don't add created by claude to the commit messages
- prefer to use polars where possible.
- **NEVER use `cd` to change directories in Bash commands** - always use absolute paths instead
  - ❌ Bad: `cd exploration && quarto render file.qmd`
  - ✅ Good: `quarto render /Users/jdonaldson/Projects/vespa/exploration/file.qmd`
  - Reason: Changing directories causes confusion and makes it hard to track working directory state
- **STRONGLY prefer make/task commands over scratch scripts**
  - ✅ Good: `make train`, `make deploy`, `make test`
  - ⚠️ Acceptable: Temporary scratch scripts in `/tmp/` for exploration or one-off analysis
  - ❌ Bad: Creating scripts for training/deploying/testing instead of using make targets
  - **Rule**: If a script is part of training, deploying, testing, building, or any repeatable workflow, it MUST be in a make/task command
  - **Why**: Make targets are documented, repeatable, version-controlled, and discoverable
  - **Exception**: Temporary exploration scripts in `/tmp/` are OK for analysis, but move to make if reused
- when running long tasks in background, automatically set up a monitoring script that rings the tmux bell (using `tput bel`) when complete

## Debrief Pattern
Use for task completions, analysis phases, major work milestones:
- **Surprised**: Unexpected findings
- **Not surprised**: Expected outcomes
- **Next**: What happens next

**Usage:**
1. User types "debrief" → Provide structured reflection (2-3 bullets per section)
2. Major phase completion → Update tmux title with debrief format

**Examples:**
```
# Command response:
Surprised: .bin files corrupted, .vec worked perfectly
Not surprised: 113K samples trained well with pretrained vectors
Next: Monitor completes, evaluate model predictions

# Tmux title:
UOM: 86K products | Surprised: CA→CS 4.1M | Not: Variance common | Next: Report
```

## Tmux Configuration

### Window Names
- Set window name to `claude:<project>-<task>` on session start
- Extract project name from working directory (e.g., "krapivin", "curvo", "bamf_docs")
- Add task suffix to distinguish multiple sessions in same project (e.g., "-uom", "-duplicates", "-buckets")
- Command: `tmux rename-window "claude:<project>-<task>"`
- Helps distinguish between multiple concurrent Claude sessions
- **Important**: When multiple Claude sessions work on the same project, each needs a unique task identifier to avoid confusion

### Pane Titles
- Set when starting major work: `Task: metrics | Context: XK/200K (X%)`
- Update at 25%, 50%, 75% context thresholds
- On completion: Use debrief format (see above)
- Command: `tmux select-pane -T "Your Title"`

## 🔄 Session Continuity Pattern

### How It Works
Projects can include a "RESUME CONTEXT - DELETE AFTER READING" section in their CLAUDE.md that enables seamless session handoffs.

### Claude's Responsibilities
When starting a new session:
1. Check for `## 🔄 RESUME CONTEXT - DELETE AFTER READING` section in project's CLAUDE.md
2. Read and process the context (understand status, blockers, next actions)
3. **Immediately delete the entire section** after reading
4. Greet the user acknowledging the resumed context
5. Continue from where the previous session left off

When ending a session (user says "shutdown", "update resume context", or similar):
1. Update the `## 🔄 RESUME CONTEXT` section with current state
2. Include: Current Status, What Was Built, Blocked On, Next Actions, Context to Remember
3. Be specific and actionable for your future self

### Template Format
```markdown
## 🔄 RESUME CONTEXT - DELETE AFTER READING

**⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE**:
- Read this section when starting a new session
- Complete any pending tasks listed here
- Delete this entire section after processing
- Continue with the conversation

### Current Status
[What's the current state of work]

### What Was Built
[List of completed work/files created]

### Blocked On
[What's preventing progress or waiting on user]

### Next Action When User Returns
[Specific steps to take when conversation resumes]

### Context to Remember
[Important decisions, preferences, or background]
```

### For Users
Run `task shutdown` (if available) or type "update resume context" to prompt Claude to write this section before ending a session.
