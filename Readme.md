Dotfiles
============

My dotfiles config.


You can fork this repo, and install a copy of it using your github username:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<GITHUB USERNAME>/dotfiles/main/.bootstrap.sh | sh
```

After the bootstrap, a copy of this Readme.md file will show up in your home
directory.  You can delete it if you want, it is ignored.
